Inspiration from the new book of Tim Ferris "Tribe of Mentors" on how to write an email saying No.

Hi xxx

I hope my email reaches you and your beloved one well.

I’m grateful for the invitation to participate in the { position/task }, but I'm struggling at this moment to make time ends meet for my current work as well as my ongoing procrastination with my own projects.

I thought carefully about this as it’s clearly a wonderful opportunity, but I'm going to decline --with gratitude.

I hope{ XXX } will be a big success!
Thanks again
