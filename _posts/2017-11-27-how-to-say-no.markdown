A great email to politely say NO to an opportunity that has been offered to you, inspired from the Tim Ferris's new book [Tribe of Mentors](http://amzn.to/2iZnTrN)

<hr>
Hi xxx

I hope my email reaches you and your beloved one well.

I’m grateful for the invitation to participate in the { position/task }, but I'm struggling at this moment to make time ends meet for my current work as well as my ongoing procrastination with my own projects.

I thought carefully about this as it’s clearly a wonderful opportunity, but I'm going to decline --with gratitude.

I hope{ XXX } will be a big success!
Thanks again
