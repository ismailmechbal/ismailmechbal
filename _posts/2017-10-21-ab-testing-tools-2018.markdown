A/B Testing is a useful tool that can improve the numbers & adoption of a product. It can be used to boost the landing page conversion rate and more importantly to improve the overall User Experience of the product by adding/removing features or simplifying the design.
Jason Fried’s known for A/B Testing of Basecamp advises "to test radically different things. We don’t know what works. Destroy all assumptions. We need to find what works and keep iterating—keep learning."

Several [A/B Testing tools](https://conversion-rate-experts.com/split-testing-software/) exists in the market, I believe the following two tools will distinguish themself in 2018.
- [Google Optimize](https://www.google.com/analytics/optimize)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

## Google Optimize
Google Optimize as described by [Sean McQuaide](https://twitter.com/seanmcquaide) is "an A/B testing and personalization tool that uses Google Analytics data to power your CRO efforts. Obviously A/B testing is nothing new, neither is serving personalized content based on customer behavior. The true progress here is how Google Optimize pairs with Google Analytics, and how easily we can tie our experiments to KPIs in Google Analytics."
