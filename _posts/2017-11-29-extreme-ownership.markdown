To know whether you have extreme ownership, answer the following simple question:

Do you take 100% responsibility & 0% blame in every single moment of every single day?

As a matter of fact, if you're blaming, even just 1%, you're not being in an extreme ownership position.

This idea came [Extreme Ownership](http://amzn.to/2ihFu0U), a book by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin.
