[Smart contracts](https://opensource.com/article/17/12/whats-blockchain-smart-contract) can be used deliberately to prevent fraud & bribery on governmental levels.

Imagine a contract that could automatically self-execute whenever a certain condition or a set of complex conditions are met with transparency and without any help from a third-party thus eliminating any middleman intervention.

Smart contracts can be used to leverage call for tender to promote fair competition.
